Hi! I’m Kabilan Mahathevan, a PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/)'s [Computer Science department](https://cs.vt.edu/). I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Kirshanthan ("Krish") Sundararajah](https://kirshanthans.github.io/). Previously I was a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore’s School of Computing, working with [Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/) in the [TEST Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/). My research focuses on building tools and techniques that make tensor computations efficient, reliable, and practical for real-world computational workloads.

If you’re interested in this area or would like to discuss related research, feel free to reach out.
