Hi! I’m Kabilan Mahathevan, currently a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore’s School of Computing, where I work in the [TEST Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/) with [Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with [Dr. Sunimal Rathnayake](https://sunimalr.staff.uom.lk/) and [Dr. Ridwan Shariffdeen](https://rshariffdeen.com/) on fuzz testing cloud platforms, which sparked my journey into academia.

I am deeply passionate about improving software performance, particularly in the area of compilers, in light of hardware limitations. As AI continues to evolve with more specialized hardware chips and machine learning techniques, there’s a growing need for efficient integration between these technologies and hardware. I aim to contribute to developing solutions that connect these components in ways that maximize performance, even with limited resources (Not limited to AI).

Teaching is another passion of mine. One of the main reasons I’m pursuing a PhD is my desire to become a professor and help nurture the next generation. My love for teaching began after high school when I volunteered to teach in remote areas of Sri Lanka. Since then, it has only grown stronger. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted peer-group sessions and served as a teaching assistant for Operating Systems, Theory of Computing, and Database Management Systems. I’m always open to opportunities for volunteer teaching, so if you ever need someone, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to help.
