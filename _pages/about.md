Hi! I’m Kabilan Mahathevan, a PhD student at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/)'s [Computer Science department](https://cs.vt.edu/). I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Kirshanthan ("Krish") Sundararajah](https://kirshanthans.github.io/). Previously I was a visiting scholar at the National University of Singapore’s School of Computing, working with [Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/) in the [TEST Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/). My research focuses on optimizing software performance, particularly in light of hardware limitations as Moore’s Law slows down. I aim to bridge the gap between software and hardware to improve computational efficiency.

Teaching is another passion of mine. One of the main reasons I’m pursuing a PhD is my desire to become a professor and help nurture the next generation. My love for teaching began after high school when I volunteered to teach in remote areas of Eelam. Since then, it has only grown stronger. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted peer-group sessions and served as a teaching assistant for Operating Systems, Theory of Computing, and Database Management Systems. I’m always open to opportunities for volunteer teaching, so if you ever need someone, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to help.
