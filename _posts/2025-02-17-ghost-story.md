#### This is a Story Happened in My Personal Which Changed My Perspective

---

I was a staunch atheist. Science and logic were my guiding principles, and I never believed in anything supernatural. That was until one strange experience changed my entire outlook on life.


During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2021, I had a routine with four close friends. Every evening, we would gather, chat about anything and everything, sometimes gossip, and then go for dinner. Our meeting spot was always the same—one of my friends' houses, conveniently located in the center of town. This friend had a habit of exaggerating stories, so we didn’t always take his words seriously.


One day, he told us that someone was throwing stones at his house from different directions. The stones were unusual, not the kind found in the nearby area. He suspected that people were trying to scare his family into leaving their home. At first, we brushed it off as another one of his exaggerated tales. But he kept repeating the story every time we met. The more he insisted, the less we paid attention.


Then, one evening, we met outside his house before heading to another friend’s place for a funeral. But something was different that day—his entire family was sitting outside, looking tense. When I asked what was happening, my friend told me that, for the past few days, stones had been appearing inside their fully closed house. They had locked all doors and windows, yet the stones still managed to get in. His family had collected a large bag full of these mysterious stones.


Curious but skeptical, I asked to go inside the house and see for myself. My other friends refused, saying they had heard strange noises from the kitchen earlier. Still, I went in with my friend. He locked all the doors and windows, making sure there was no way for anyone to throw anything from outside. Then, he called out loudly, as if inviting something to reveal itself. I found this amusing and couldn't help but laugh. It reminded me of ghost-hunting shows from my childhood. Nothing happened at first, and I was about to dismiss the whole thing when, suddenly, a stone landed on a metal plate on the dining table.


There was no one else in the house. No hidden places. No logical explanation. Yet, a stone had appeared from nowhere.


Still determined to find an answer, I stayed quiet about what I had seen. Later, two men from a nearby workshop came by, curious about the rumors. My friend invited them in, and I joined them. This time, as my friend repeated his ritual, something happened that I will never forget.


I saw a stone appear in mid-air—just a few feet in front of me. It wasn’t there one moment, and the next, it materialized out of thin air before being thrown across the room, hitting a wall.


I ran outside, terrified. I told my friends what I had seen, and we discussed it at length, but I couldn’t explain it. Later that night, at the funeral house, another friend shared similar eerie experiences from his shop in the same town. Normally, I would have dismissed such stories, but now, I couldn't.


A few days later, when we met again, my friend’s family was back inside their home. I asked what had changed. He told me that a temple priest had visited their house, performed a ritual, and lit a candle, asking them to let it burn for a day. After that, the disturbances stopped completely.


This experience shook me to the core. It made me realize that there are things in this world beyond human understanding. We perceive only a tiny fraction of reality, and there is so much more that we might never comprehend.


Since then, I have embraced my roots and started following Sanatana Dharma. Even if there is no god, I believe this path provides wisdom, discipline, and a sense of purpose. I no longer dismiss the unknown so easily, and I walk forward with a newfound respect for the mysteries of life.
